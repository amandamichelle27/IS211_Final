# IS211_Final

A database is not shipped with this project - it will automatically initialize within the application's directory when the application is first run. A new user is created anytime credentials are entered with a unique username. If the username already exists but the password is incorrect, the action will be canceled; otherwise the user will be logged in and directed to the dashboard.

From there, the user can view the books they have previously selected, remove any with the corresponding butotn, and search for more by ISBN or title, selecting the match of their choice to add. The user can also logout so that a new user can be used.
